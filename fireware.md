# Firewall\(固件\)

In[electronic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_system)and[computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing),**firmware**[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-2)is a specific class of computer[software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software)that provides the low-level control for the device's specific[hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware). Firmware can either provide a standardized operating environment for the device's more complex[software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software)\(allowing more[hardware-independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting)\), or, for less complex devices, act as the device's complete[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), performing all control, monitoring and data manipulation functions. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are[embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_systems), consumer appliances, computers, computer peripherals, and others. Almost all electronic devices beyond the simplest contain some firmware.

Firmware is held in[non-volatile memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory)devices such as[ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory),[EPROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPROM), or[flash memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory). Changing the firmware of a device may rarely or never be done during its lifetime; some firmware memory devices are permanently installed and cannot be changed after manufacture. Common reasons for updating firmware include fixing bugs or adding features to the device. This may require ROM[integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit)to be physically replaced, or flash memory to be reprogrammed through a special procedure.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-3)Firmware such as the[ROM BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_BIOS)of a personal computer may contain only elementary basic functions of a device and may only provide services to higher-level software. Firmware such as the program of an embedded system may be the only program that will run on the system and provide all of its functions.

Before the inclusion of integrated circuits, other firmware devices included a[discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_diode)semiconductor[diode matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode_matrix). The[Apollo guidance computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_guidance_computer)had firmware consisting of a specially manufactured[core memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory)plane, called "[core rope memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory)", where data was stored by physically threading wires through \(1\) or around \(0\) the core storing each data bit.

## History

Ascher Opler coined the term "firmware" in a 1967[Datamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datamation)article.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-Opler-5)Originally, it meant the contents of a writable[control store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_store)\(a small specialized high speed memory\), containing[microcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode)that defined and implemented the computer's[instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set), and that could be reloaded to specialize or modify the instructions that the[central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)\(CPU\) could execute. As originally used, firmware contrasted with hardware \(the CPU itself\) and software \(normal instructions executing on a CPU\). It was not composed of CPU machine instructions, but of lower-level microcode involved in the implementation of machine instructions. It existed on the boundary between hardware and software; thus the name "firmware". Over time, popular usage extended the word "firmware" to denote any computer program that is tightly linked to hardware, including processor machine instructions for[BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS),[bootstrap loaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting), or the control systems for simple[electronic devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics)such as a[microwave oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven),[remote control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control), or[computer peripheral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_peripheral).

## Applications\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Firmware&action=edit&section=2)\]

### Personal computers\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Firmware&action=edit&section=3)\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/AMI_486DX_EISA_BIOS_20051109.jpg/220px-AMI_486DX_EISA_BIOS_20051109.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AMI_486DX_EISA_BIOS_20051109.jpg)

ROM [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) firmware on a [Baby AT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_AT) [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard)

In some respects, the various firmware components are as important as the[operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)in a working computer. However, unlike most modern operating systems, firmware rarely has a well-evolved automatic mechanism of updating itself to fix any functionality issues detected after shipping the unit.

The BIOS may be "manually" updated by a user, using a small utility program. In contrast, firmware in storage devices \(harddisks, DVD drives, flash storage\) rarely gets updated, even when flash \(rather than ROM\) storage is used for the firmware; there are no standardized mechanisms for detecting or updating firmware versions.

Most computer peripherals are themselves special-purpose computers. Devices such as printers, scanners, cameras and[USB flash drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive)have internally stored firmware; some devices may also permit field upgrading of their firmware.

Some low-cost peripherals no longer contain non-volatile memory for firmware, and instead rely on the host system to transfer the device control program from a disk file or CD.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-6)

### Consumer products

As of 2010, most[portable music players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_music_player)support firmware upgrades. Some companies use firmware updates to add new playable file formats \(codecs\);[iriver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iriver)added[Vorbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis)playback support this way, for instance. Other features that may change with firmware updates include the GUI or even the battery life. Most[mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone)have a[Firmware Over The Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware_Over_The_Air)firmware upgrade capability for much the same reasons; some may even be upgraded to enhance reception or sound quality, illustrating that firmware is used at more than one level in complex products \(in a CPU-like[microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller)versus in a[digital signal processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor), in this particular case\).

### Automobiles

Since 1996, most[automobiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile)have employed an on-board computer and various sensors to detect mechanical problems. As of 2010, modern vehicles also employ computer-controlled[anti-lock braking systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-lock_braking_system)\(ABS\) and computer-operated[transmission control units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_control_unit)\(TCUs\). The driver can also get in-dash information while driving in this manner, such as real-time fuel economy and tire pressure readings. Local dealers can update most vehicle firmware.

  ## Flashing

  **Flashing**[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-techfaq-7)involves the overwriting of existing firmware or data, contained in[EEPROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM)or[flash memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory)modules present in an electronic device, with new data.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-techfaq-7)This can be done to upgrade a device[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-8)or to change the[provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider)of a service associated with the function of the device, such as changing from one mobile phone service provider to another or installing a new operating system. If firmware is upgradable, it is often done via a program from the provider, and will often allow the old firmware to be saved before upgrading so it can be reverted to if the process fails, or if the newer version performs worse.

## Firmware hacking\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Firmware&action=edit&section=8)\]

Main article:

[Custom firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_firmware)

Sometimes, third parties create an unofficial new or modified \("aftermarket"\) version of firmware to provide new features or to unlock hidden functionality; this is referred to as[custom firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_firmware). An example is[Rockbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockbox)as a firmware replacement for[portable media players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_media_players). There are many[homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_%28video_games%29)projects for video game consoles, which often unlock general-purpose computing functionality in previously limited devices \(e.g., running[Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%281993_video_game%29)on[iPods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod)\).

Firmware hacks usually take advantage of the firmware update facility on many devices to install or run themselves. Some, however, must resort to[exploits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29)to run, because the manufacturer has attempted to lock the hardware to stop it from running[unlicensed code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsigned_code).

Most firmware hacks are[free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

### HDD firmware hacks

The Moscow-based[Kaspersky Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab)discovered that a group of developers it refers to as the "[Equation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group)" has developed[hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive)firmware modifications for various drive models, containing a[trojan horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29)that allows data to be stored on the drive in locations that will not be erased even if the drive is formatted or wiped.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-9)Although the Kaspersky Lab report did not explicitly claim that this group is part of the United States[National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency)\(NSA\), evidence obtained from the code of various Equation Group software suggests that they are part of the NSA.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-10)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-11)

Researchers from the Kaspersky Lab categorized the undertakings by Equation Group as the most advanced hacking operation ever uncovered, also documenting around 500 infections caused by the Equation Group in at least 42 countries.

## Security risks

[Mark Shuttleworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth), the founder of the company[Canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_%28company%29), which maintains the[Ubuntu Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Linux)distribution, has described[proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software)firmware as a security risk, saying that "firmware on your device is the[NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA)'s best friend" and calling firmware "a trojan horse of monumental proportions". He has asserted that low-quality,[closed source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software)firmware is a major threat to system security:[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-linux-mag-162-12)"Your biggest mistake is to assume that the NSA is the only institution abusing this position of trust – in fact, it's reasonable to assume that all firmware is a cesspool of insecurity, courtesy of incompetence of the highest degree from manufacturers, and competence of the highest degree from a very wide range of such agencies". As a potential solution to this problem, he has called for declarative firmware, which would describe "hardware linkage and dependencies" and "should not include[executable code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_code)".[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-13)Firmware should be[open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)so that the code can be checked and verified.

Custom firmware hacks have also focused on injecting[malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)into devices such as smartphones or[USB devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_device). One such smartphone injection was demonstrated on the[Symbian OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian_OS#Malware)at[MalCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcon),[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-14)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-15)a[hacker convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_convention). A USB device firmware hack calledBadUSBwas presented at[Black Hat USA 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hat_Briefings)conference,[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-16)demonstrating how a[USB flash drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive)microcontroller can be reprogrammed to spoof various other device types to take control of a computer, exfiltrate data, or spy on the user.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-17)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-18)Other security researchers have worked further on how to exploit the principles behind BadUSB,[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-19)releasing at the same time the source code of hacking tools that can be used to modify the behavior of different USB devices.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#cite_note-20)
