Sounds like that battery may need to be replaced. But before doing that I would ensure the server firmware is up to date, including the RAID controller firmware and driver. Ensure open manage is up to date as well. And if you are able it never hurts to check the battery connection and make sure it is secure to the RAID controller.

If you still get error about the battery, you can do further investigating by looking at the RAID controller log. But more than likely the battery would need to be replaced.
